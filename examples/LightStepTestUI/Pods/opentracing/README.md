# OpenTracing API for Objective-C

This library is a Objective-C/cocoa platform API for OpenTracing.

## Required Reading

In order to understand the Python platform API, one must first be familiar with
the [OpenTracing project](http://opentracing.io) and
[terminology](http://opentracing.io/spec/) more generally.

## Status

**This is a work-in-progress codebase.** Caveat emptor re backwards-incompatible changes, etc.

## Installation (CocoaPods)

Use [CocoaPods](https://guides.cocoapods.org/using/getting-started.html)!

```ruby
pod "opentracing"
```
